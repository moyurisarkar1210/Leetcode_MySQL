-- Solution 1 --
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs L1, Logs L2, Logs L3
WHERE L1.id = L2.id -1 AND  L2.id = L3.id -1 AND L1.num = L2.num AND L2.num = L3.num



--Solution 2 --

SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums 
FROM (
    SELECT num,
    LEAD(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_num,
    LEAD(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_next_num
    FROM Logs
) AS Subquery
WHERE num = next_num AND num = next_next_num
